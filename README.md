# Object_Oriented_programming
Most important concepts of OPPs for interviews.
Hello Guys, I have made this repo in which I have implemented all the important concepts of Object oriented programming.
The order in which you can go though the concepts are numbered .
I would advise you to read the files along with Theory.txt file , Comments are written where ever it was necessary.
I will be updating the files in future but this is enough to help you with interviews and exams.
